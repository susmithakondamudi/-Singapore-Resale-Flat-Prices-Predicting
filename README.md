# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting

Forecasting Singapore's resale flat prices through comprehensive analysis of economic indicators, housing market trends, and demographic factors, enabling stakeholders to make informed real estate decisions

# Introduction

This project focuses on predicting resale prices for flats in Singapore using machine learning. By leveraging historical transaction data and key features, the project aims to provide accurate estimates for resale prices, aiding potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.

# Problem Statement

Estimating resale prices accurately in the competitive Singapore housing market is challenging. This project addresses this issue by employing data preprocessing techniques, exploratory and multivariate analyses, and building machine learning models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and  random forests ) to predict resale prices.

# Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to contribute valuable insights to users navigating the complexities of the real estate market in Singapore. The project provides estimated resale prices to assist individuals in their decision-making process when dealing with resale flat transactions.

# Features

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Importing necessary packages, reading and merging datasets, and performing initial data preprocessing tasks.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 

Gaining insights into the dataset through basic statistics, univariate and bivariate analyses, and the detection of aberrant or missing values.


Model Building and Evaluation: Constructing and evaluating Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and random forests  models for predicting resale prices.


# Data Source
The dataset used in this project was collected from [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/)

# Project Progress
# Data Preprocessing:
 Importing Necessary Packages This step involves importing essential libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

Reading and Merging Data Datasets are read and merged, combining relevant information for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) EDA involves exploring the dataset through statistical measures and visualizations to understand patterns and trends.

Multivariate Analysis Multivariate analysis encompasses exploring relationships between multiple variables, aiding in a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

# Model Building and Evaluation

Linear Regression Linear Regression is employed to model the relationship between independent variables and resale prices. Model evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, R-squared Score

Decision Trees Decision Trees are utilized to model resale prices based on key features. Model evaluation follows similar metrics as in Linear Regression.
